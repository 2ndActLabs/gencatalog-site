# GenCatalog Site Development Log


## 2026-09-22 — Desktop 5.16.95 release surfaces

Updated index.html and get.html using scripts/update-version.sh after both final
installers returned HTTP 200. Added concise customer-facing App polish notes in
release-notes.html; updated sitemap.xml and matching middleware dates for the
homepage and release notes. Daniel additionally approved correcting the existing
/grok header date to September 14 to match its existing sitemap date and unblock
the crawl-freshness check. No /grok content changed.

Desktop 5.16.95 artifacts and updater feeds are published at both download root
and updates/. All 16 public objects passed byte/size comparisons with the tested
local files; release evidence is /Users/danieldavis/Dev/builds/release-5-16-95/.
Mac universal signing/notarization/staples and packaged parity passed. Windows
NSIS installation and real app/server upload checks passed under Wine; physical
Windows 11 acceptance remains pending. Extension 5.137 is prepared separately,
not submitted/published, and is not described as a public extension release here.

Validation: version guard, crawl freshness, HTML validator and diff checks pass.
The original site checkout's unrelated changes are preserved; this release uses
its clean linked worktree. Next: merge this site PR, verify the matching Pages
production deployment and canonical homepage/get/release-notes, then remove the
clean release worktree. Codex owns this publication verification.

## 2026-08-03 — Rebuild the Grok page around creative ownership

### Customer-facing change

- Rebuilt the canonical `/grok` page as an editorial guide for serious Grok
  Imagine creators, centered on creative ownership, the emotional peaks and
  valleys of the platform, and the future value of preserved prompts and
  references.
- Added a source-aware preservation table that distinguishes information
  captured from Grok from tags, notes, ratings, collections, and recipes
  created locally in GenCatalog. Availability limits are stated beside every
  platform-derived field.
- Organized the complete Grok feature inventory around preservation,
  organization, search, reuse, multiple accounts, upgrades, and privacy rather
  than presenting a chronological feature dump.
- Kept recent moderation changes to one evergreen reminder that platform
  boundaries change. The page does not claim that canceling a subscription
  deletes work or that GenCatalog can recover media Grok no longer exposes.
- Clarified throughout the page that 1080p Grok video upgrades require a Grok
  Heavy subscription; 720p remains the standard Grok upgrade path.

### Current product evidence

- Captured the current shipping app against a public-safe Grok grid on August
  3, 2026. The new visuals show a 34,799-item catalog, six-account refinement,
  current detail and creative-lineage controls, local reference state, the
  in-app 1080p upgrade selector for Grok Heavy subscribers, current Recipe
  View, and the account-scoped reference browser.
- Replaced private reference previews with clearly illustrative, public-safe
  placeholder imagery while preserving the current reference-browser UI,
  filters, counts, copy states, and repair guidance.
- Added an illustrative moonlit-tree source preview to the current Recipe View
  capture so both source and result stages are visible. The page labels the
  substituted source and reference imagery as illustrative.
- Retained the existing Grok-side Save / Save + Favorite image because it
  documents the browser capture interaction; all desktop-app proof was
  replaced with current captures.

### Files

- `grok.html`
- `sitemap.xml`
- `functions/_middleware.js`
- `scripts/test-html-validator.mjs`
- `uploads_v2/GrokAccounts-20260803.webp`
- `uploads_v2/GrokDetailLineage-20260803.webp`

- `uploads_v2/GrokSearchSidebar-20260803.webp`
- `uploads_v2/GrokVideoUpgrade-20260803.webp`
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Validation

- `scripts/update-version.sh --check` — passed at desktop `5.16.88`; both
  public installers returned HTTP 200.
- `xmllint --noout sitemap.xml` — passed.
- `node scripts/check-crawl-freshness.mjs` and
  `node scripts/test-html-validator.mjs` — passed with the `/grok` sitemap,
  Last-Modified header, and conditional-request fixture aligned to August 3.
- Parsed all three JSON-LD blocks and verified all local image references.
- Verified 33 internal, asset, in-page, and external link targets and confirmed
  there are no duplicate IDs.
- Rendered the page at 1440px and 390px. Both layouts have zero horizontal
  overflow; all nine images load at their declared intrinsic dimensions.
- `git diff --check` — passed.

### Lesson

Marketing captures for a fast-moving desktop product must come from the
current shipping interface, not merely from the newest image already present
in the website repository. Existing screenshots can remain only when they
still prove a separate, unchanged interaction.

## 2026-08-03 — Document account-matched Grok reference repair

### Customer-facing change

- Added a guided support workflow for storing exact local copies of older Grok
  reference images, including the requirement to use the matching Grok account
  in Chrome and repeat the repair for each historical account.
- Explained the stored, unavailable, and retryable result states without
  implying that a derived generation or video frame replaces the original.
- Documented the References browser's service, account, copy-state, date, and
  sorting controls, plus the complete desktop Go menu destination list.
- Preserved unrelated support, homepage, pricing, download, and release copy.

### Files

- `support.html`
- `sitemap.xml`
- `functions/_middleware.js`
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Validation

- Run HTML, crawl-freshness, version-surface, JavaScript, XML, and whitespace
  checks before publication.
- Verify the canonical `/support` page at desktop and mobile widths, including
  the exact-account guidance, result meanings, reference filters, and Go menu
  destinations.

---

## 2026-08-01 — Publish GenCatalog desktop 5.16.87

### Customer-facing change

- Advanced the homepage and download experience from desktop `5.16.86` to
  `5.16.87` after the owner accepted the packaged Mac build and both public
  installers and updater feeds were verified live.
- Added feature-forward release notes for improved large-library organization,
  visible slideshow preparation and current-item actions, and reliable
  Rediscover actions and tag synchronization.
- Kept Extension `5.129` out of the public release heading because its verified
  ZIP remains a manual Chrome Web Store handoff rather than a published store
  version.
- Corrected the pre-existing `/support` freshness date mismatch left by its
  July 30 content update so the required site-wide freshness gate can pass;
  support-page content is unchanged.
- Preserved all unrelated homepage, pricing, product, support, and historical
  release-note copy.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `get.html`
- `release-notes.html`
- `sitemap.xml`
- `functions/_middleware.js`
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Validation

- Run the version/artifact, crawl-freshness, HTML, JavaScript, XML, release-note
  structure, and repository-whitespace checks before publication.
- Verify the merged deployment on the canonical homepage, `/get`,
  `/release-notes`, and `sitemap.xml`, including version text, download targets,
  customer copy, and response freshness headers.

---

## 2026-07-28 — Aligned pricing-page freshness metadata

### What Changed
- Updated sitemap and response freshness dates for the homepage and the
  pricing surfaces changed by the applicable-tax disclosure.
- Preserved every unrelated route's existing freshness date.

### Verification
- Ran the crawl-freshness, HTML validation, version-consistency,
  subscription-copy, and repository whitespace checks.

### Lesson
Customer-facing pricing changes must update both sitemap and response freshness
metadata so production cache refreshes and crawler signals stay synchronized.

---

## 2026-07-28 — Moved the homepage tax note beside the price

### What Changed
- Moved “Plus applicable taxes” out of the cancellation and ownership line
  and directly beneath “per year • billed annually” in the homepage price
  block.
- Restored the original cancellation copy exactly.
- Added a dedicated muted 10px treatment so the disclosure reads as price
  context without competing with the $99 annual price.

### Verification
- Rendered the homepage price block locally and compared the computed price,
  billing-detail, tax-note, and cancellation-copy styles.
- Ran the subscription-copy checker and repository whitespace validation.

### Lesson
Tax context belongs with the price and billing cadence. Cancellation and
lasting-library copy should remain a separate customer promise.

---

## 2026-07-28 — Clarified tax-exclusive annual pricing

### What Changed
- Added concise “plus applicable taxes” language anywhere the public site
  presents the $99 annual price, including the homepage, download handoff,
  FAQ, focused landing pages, supporting article, structured answers, and
  crawler-facing summaries.
- Reused each surface’s existing small-print or supporting-copy treatment so
  the disclosure is clear without changing the pricing hierarchy or design.
- Left the Terms unchanged because they already state that applicable taxes
  may be added at checkout.

### Verification
- Audited every customer-facing `$99`, `99/year`, and `99 per year`
  occurrence in the current site source.
- Ran the subscription-copy checker and repository whitespace validation.

### Lesson
When checkout prices are tax-exclusive, the base annual price should remain
prominent while applicable-tax language appears consistently at every public
pricing decision point, including structured and crawler-facing copy.

---
## 2026-07-26 — Publish GenCatalog desktop 5.16.86

### Customer-facing change

- Advanced the homepage and download experience from desktop `5.16.85` to
  `5.16.86` after both public installers and updater feeds were verified live.
- Added one concise App Polish note explaining that some Windows customers can
  again activate a valid existing license.
- Preserved Extension `5.126`, the existing homepage and product copy, and
  every earlier release-note entry.
- Corrected the sitemap and HTML `Last-Modified` dates to the source commit date
  so the post-merge crawl-freshness check matches a clean GitHub checkout.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `get.html`
- `release-notes.html`
- `sitemap.xml`
- `functions/_middleware.js`
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Validation

- Run `bash scripts/update-version.sh --check`, crawl-freshness, HTML
  middleware, JavaScript syntax, sitemap XML, and `git diff --check` before
  publication.
- Verify the merged production deployment with cache-busted requests for the
  homepage, `/get`, `/release-notes`, and `sitemap.xml`.

---
## 2026-07-26 — Align 5.16.85 crawler dates with the committed release

### Scope

- Keep the `5.16.85` public content unchanged.
- Align homepage and release-note sitemap and response dates with the actual
  July 26 Git commit date used by the clean main-branch crawler check.

### Files

- `sitemap.xml`
- `functions/_middleware.js`
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Validation

- Run the same crawl-freshness, HTML middleware, version, JavaScript, sitemap,
  and diff checks used by the main-branch deployment workflow.

---
## 2026-07-26 — Publish GenCatalog desktop 5.16.85

### Customer-facing change

- Advanced the homepage and download experience from desktop `5.16.84` to
  `5.16.85` after both public installers returned HTTP `200`.
- Added one concise App Polish note explaining that returning Windows customers
  can regain access reliably after reinstalling or moving to a new device.
- Preserved Extension `5.126`, the existing homepage and product copy, and
  every earlier release-note entry.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `get.html`
- `release-notes.html`
- `sitemap.xml`
- `functions/_middleware.js`
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Validation

- Run `bash scripts/update-version.sh --check`, crawl-freshness, HTML
  middleware, JavaScript syntax, sitemap XML, and `git diff --check` before
  publication.
- Verify the merged production deployment with cache-busted requests for the
  homepage, `/get`, `/release-notes`, and `sitemap.xml`.

---
## 2026-07-26 — Keep the Resin FAL addition out of public notes

### Scope

- Removed the FAL section from the public `5.16.84 + Extension 5.126` release
  note.
- Kept the customer-facing App Polish note and every earlier release entry
  unchanged.
- FAL source classification remains a silent Resin addition.

### Files

- `release-notes.html`
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Validation

- `bash scripts/update-version.sh --check`, crawl-freshness, HTML middleware,
  JavaScript syntax, sitemap XML, and `git diff --check` all passed.
- Release-note assertions prove exactly one Latest marker and one
  `5.16.84 + Extension 5.126` heading, preserve the App Polish and `5.16.83`
  content, and find no public FAL heading or copy.
- Removal PR `#54` passed its Cloudflare Pages check and merged as `094142d4`.
  Main-branch crawl-freshness and cache-purge run `30206335031` passed against
  that exact merge commit.
- A cache-busted production request confirmed the live release note retains the
  `5.16.84 + Extension 5.126` heading, App Polish copy, one Latest marker, and
  the full `5.16.83` entry while exposing no FAL heading or copy.

---
## 2026-07-26 — Publish GenCatalog 5.16.84 and extension 5.126

### Customer-facing change

- Advanced the homepage and download experience from desktop `5.16.83` to
  `5.16.84` after both public installers returned HTTP `200`.
- Added one App Polish note covering reliable Favorite behavior during live
  imports, clear active Compare state, and stronger Higgsfield output/project
  context.
- Kept the new FAL source classification intentionally out of public notes as a
  silent addition for Resin.
- Preserved the existing homepage, product claims, pricing, support content,
  and every earlier release-note entry.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `get.html`
- `release-notes.html`
- `DEVLOG.md`

The homepage and release-notes sitemap dates and response-freshness dates were
already July 26, so the version update correctly produced no `sitemap.xml` or
`functions/_middleware.js` diff.

### Validation

- `bash scripts/update-version.sh --check` — passed with every public version
  surface at `5.16.84` and both installers returning HTTP `200`.
- `node scripts/check-crawl-freshness.mjs` — passed across 26 sitemap URLs and
  26 indexable canonical HTML files.
- `node scripts/test-html-validator.mjs`, `node --check
  functions/_middleware.js`, `xmllint --noout sitemap.xml`, and
  `git diff --check` — passed.
- Release-note assertions prove exactly one Latest marker and one
  `5.16.84 + Extension 5.126` heading, preserve the full `5.16.83` entry, and
  include the approved App Polish customer copy.
- Release PR `#52` passed its Cloudflare Pages check and merged as `4a718296`.
  Main-branch crawl-freshness and cache-purge run `30206176483` passed against
  that exact merge commit.
- Cache-busted production requests returned HTTP `200` for the homepage,
  `/get`, `/release-notes`, and `sitemap.xml`. Structured data, hero, footer,
  and both download variables report `5.16.84`; release notes have one Latest
  marker, the new `5.16.84 + Extension 5.126` entry, and the complete
  `5.16.83` entry.
- Changed homepage and release-note HTML return July 26 `Last-Modified`,
  `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate`, and
  `CF-Cache-Status: DYNAMIC`.

---
## 2026-07-26 — Publish GenCatalog 5.16.83

### Customer-facing change

- Advanced the homepage and download experience from desktop `5.16.82` to
  `5.16.83` after both public installers returned HTTP `200`.
- Added one customer-facing App Polish note: returning customers can reactivate
  smoothly after reinstalling or resetting a device.
- Preserved the existing homepage, product claims, extension version, pricing,
  support content, and all earlier release notes.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `get.html`
- `release-notes.html`
- `sitemap.xml`
- `functions/_middleware.js`
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Validation

- `bash scripts/update-version.sh --check` — passed with every public version
  surface at `5.16.83` and both installers returning HTTP `200`.
- `node scripts/check-crawl-freshness.mjs` — passed across 26 sitemap URLs and
  26 indexable canonical HTML files.
- `node scripts/test-html-validator.mjs`, `node --check
  functions/_middleware.js`, `xmllint --noout sitemap.xml`, and
  `git diff --check` — passed.
- Release PR `#50` passed its Cloudflare Pages check and merged as `0fd984fe`.
  The matching main-branch crawl-verification and cache-purge workflow passed.
- Cache-busted production requests returned HTTP `200` for the homepage,
  `/get`, `/release-notes`, and `sitemap.xml`. Structured data, hero, footer,
  and both download variables report `5.16.83`; release notes contain exactly
  one Latest marker, the new App Polish note, and the complete `5.16.82` entry.
  The changed HTML routes return July 26 `Last-Modified` values and remain
  dynamically served at the Cloudflare edge.

---
## 2026-07-23 — Publish GenCatalog 5.16.82

### Customer-facing change

- Advanced the homepage and download experience from desktop `5.16.81` to
  `5.16.82` after both public installers returned HTTP `200`.
- Added one customer-facing App Polish note: long-running imports remain
  responsive during slow storage operations.
- Preserved the existing homepage, product claims, extension version, pricing,
  support content, and all earlier release notes.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `get.html`
- `release-notes.html`
- `DEVLOG.md`

The homepage and release-notes sitemap dates were already July 23, so the
version helper correctly produced no `sitemap.xml` diff.

### Validation

- `bash scripts/update-version.sh --check` — passed with every public version
  surface at `5.16.82` and both installers returning HTTP `200`.
- `node scripts/check-crawl-freshness.mjs` — passed across 26 sitemap URLs and
  26 indexable canonical HTML files.
- `node scripts/test-html-validator.mjs`, `xmllint --noout sitemap.xml`, and
  `git diff --check` — passed.

---
## 2026-07-23 — Publish GenCatalog 5.16.81

### Customer-facing change

- Advanced the homepage and download experience from desktop `5.16.80` to
  `5.16.81` after both public installers returned HTTP `200`.
- Added one customer-facing App Polish note: large imports stay responsive when
  external catalog storage is slow or temporarily unavailable.
- Preserved the existing homepage, product claims, extension version, pricing,
  support content, and all unrelated release notes.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `get.html`
- `release-notes.html`
- `DEVLOG.md`

The homepage and release-notes sitemap dates were already July 23, so the
version helper correctly produced no `sitemap.xml` diff.

### Validation

- `bash scripts/update-version.sh --check` — passed with every public version
  surface at `5.16.81` and both installers returning HTTP `200`.
- `node scripts/check-crawl-freshness.mjs` — passed across 26 sitemap URLs and
  26 indexable canonical HTML files.
- `node scripts/test-html-validator.mjs`, `xmllint --noout sitemap.xml`, and
  `git diff --check` — passed.
- The older optional subscription-draft audit still expects an annual checkout
  URL in `llms.txt` that current `origin/main` no longer contains. This release
  does not change `llms.txt`, pricing, or checkout behavior, and the active
  deploy workflow does not run that stale assertion.
- Release PR `#47` passed its Cloudflare Pages check and merged as `9ed7611`.
  The main-branch crawl-verification and cache-purge workflow passed against
  that exact merge commit.
- Cache-busted production requests confirmed the homepage, `/get`,
  `/release-notes`, and `sitemap.xml` at HTTP `200`. The homepage structured
  data, hero, footer, and download handoff all report `5.16.81`; release notes
  contain exactly one Latest marker and one `5.16.81` heading, while preserving
  the complete `5.16.80` entry.

---
## 2026-07-23 — Harden crawler freshness and cache invalidation

### Diagnosis

- Direct custom-domain, Pages-origin, cache-busted, and no-cache requests all
  returned current HTML with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0,
  must-revalidate`; the custom domain reported `CF-Cache-Status: DYNAMIC` with
  no `Age`.
- The production Pages deployment matched current `main`, so the July crawler
  evidence was not reproducible at the active EWR edge or the Pages hostname.
- HTML responses had neither `ETag` nor `Last-Modified`, 22 sitemap entries
  understated their pages' actual July change dates, and legacy crawlable
  references remained in several otherwise-current pages.

### Changes

- Added content-derived weak ETags plus sitemap-backed `Last-Modified` dates
  for successful HTML responses, with correct conditional-request handling
  through Pages middleware. Browser copies must revalidate, while
  `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control: no-store` keeps HTML out of Cloudflare's
  shared edge cache.
- Changed the zone-wide Browser Cache TTL from four hours to Respect Existing
  Headers so the Pages response policy is not lengthened at Cloudflare.
- Updated `sitemap.xml` dates to match the corresponding page changes and added
  a crawl-freshness guard that checks sitemap coverage, dates, robots,
  canonical/noindex boundaries, current facts, and stale markers.
- Updated `llms.txt`, added `llms-full.txt`, repaired old homepage anchors and
  Grok navigation labels, updated structured-data logo URLs, and removed the
  orphaned legacy PNG.
- Added a main-branch workflow that waits for the matching Pages production
  deployment before purging the zone cache, plus a manual purge script.

### Validation

- `node scripts/check-crawl-freshness.mjs` — passed for 26 sitemap URLs and 26
  indexable canonical HTML files.
- `node scripts/test-html-validator.mjs` — passed.
- Local Pages runtime — all seven audited HTML routes returned unique
  content-derived ETags and `304` for matching `If-None-Match`.
- `xmllint --noout sitemap.xml`, `bash scripts/update-version.sh --check`, and
  `git diff --check` — passed.

---
## 2026-07-21 — Refresh the homepage for Sources and Generation Recipes

### Scope and decisions

- Preserved the homepage headline, problem framing, structure, pacing, pricing
  model, and closing promise. The central customer outcome remains an organized,
  searchable local library; the refresh updates the parts of that story that
  had begun to undersell the product.
- Reframed prompt and metadata preservation as preserving how a result was
  made, then introduced Generation Recipes once as the product name for that
  richer record. Kept familiar prompt, model, setting, and resource language
  everywhere else rather than repeating the term throughout the page.
- Expanded the workflow from browser capture and one-time imports to Sources
  and watched folders. Public copy leads with the customer benefit—new work
  appearing automatically while originals remain in place—and avoids internal
  acquisition terminology.
- Aligned the page title, social descriptions, SoftwareApplication schema, and
  visible FAQ schema with the refreshed Sources and recipe story.
- Kept the closing positioning unchanged. “Searchable library” remains the
  clearest immediate promise; creative history is the value GenCatalog
  preserves inside that library, not a replacement category.

### Visuals

- Replaced the older detail screenshot with a current Generation Recipe view.
- Replaced the simplified Recipe Card with a full export based on a ComfyUI
  workflow: one checkpoint, three LoRAs, two generation stages, settings,
  resources, and original embedded evidence. The fixture artwork is original,
  public-safe, and contains no customer content.
- Replaced the one-time import panel with the current Sources screen showing
  connected watched folders and live status.
- Retained the existing homepage CSS after desktop and mobile review; the new
  assets fit the established layout without responsive changes.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `uploads_v2/GenerationRecipeView-20260721.webp`
- `uploads_v2/GenerationRecipeExport-20260721.webp`
- `uploads_v2/SourcesWatchedFolders-20260721.webp`
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Validation

- Parsed all three JSON-LD blocks in `index.html` — passed.
- `node scripts/check-subscription-draft.mjs` — passed across 30 customer files
  and 53 JSON-LD blocks.
- `bash scripts/update-version.sh --check` — passed with every public version
  surface at 5.16.78 and both release artifacts returning HTTP `200`.
- Desktop review at 1440px and mobile review at 390px — no horizontal overflow;
  all new images load at their declared aspect ratios.
- `git diff --check` — passed.

### Lesson

The product has not outgrown its central story. It has outgrown several
descriptions inside that story: “prompts and metadata” no longer conveys the
workflow knowledge GenCatalog can preserve, and “local import” no longer
conveys the continuing value of Sources and watched folders.

### Browser review refinements

- Added an intentional break before “Not just the file.” in the save heading.
- Added an intentional break before “New work appears automatically.” and
  removed the restrictive heading-width constraint so the sentence can occupy
  its own line when space permits.
- Kept “See what one parameter changes.” on one line at desktop widths while
  preserving normal wrapping on mobile.
- Verified the three headings at the annotated 1784px desktop viewport and a
  390px mobile viewport with no horizontal overflow.
- Replaced the CSS-dependent sentence breaks with explicit HTML line breaks
  after a cached older stylesheet rendered the sentences together. Advanced
  the homepage stylesheet cache key so the associated heading refinements load
  reliably for returning visitors.
- Vertically centered the Find section copy beside its tall sidebar screenshot
  so the text and visual read as one balanced composition instead of leaving
  the explanation pinned to the top of the section.

---
## 2026-07-19 — Publish GenCatalog 5.16.74

- Added customer-facing release notes for the thoughtfully timed, one-time
  Chrome Web Store review request and the privacy-preserving aggregate signals
  used to improve the trial and onboarding experience.
- Advanced the shared Mac and Windows version surfaces only after both final
  artifacts, their blockmaps, and both updater feeds were public at the bucket
  root and `updates/` paths.
- Kept the release note focused on what customers can see and rely on; build,
  repository, receiver, and deployment proof remains in internal logs.

### Files

- `release-notes.html`
- `index.html` and `get.html` through `scripts/update-version.sh 5.16.74`
- `DEVLOG.md`

The sitemap already carried the current July 19 last-modified date, so the
version updater correctly produced no sitemap diff.

### Validation

- `scripts/update-version.sh 5.16.74` — passed the live-artifact gate and
  aligned all public desktop version surfaces.
- `scripts/update-version.sh --check` — passed with both 5.16.74 artifacts
  returning HTTP `200`.
- Parsed all JSON-LD blocks in `index.html` and `faq.html` — passed.
- `git diff --check` — passed.

---
## 2026-07-19 — Disclose anonymous journey analytics

- Updated the privacy policy and FAQ to describe the refreshed notice for older
  former-default-off installations while preserving explicit opt-outs.
- Disclosed the coarse journey milestones, local-only opaque completion
  markers, and the absence of a persistent identifier or person-level journey.
- Added the integrated review-request counts and their broad bucket limits.
- Kept the visible FAQ answer aligned with FAQPage JSON-LD.
- Verified `git diff --check` and parsed every JSON-LD block in both pages.

### Lesson

“Existing choices are preserved” was too broad once ambiguous legacy defaults
and explicit opt-outs required different handling.

---
## 2026-07-19 — Clarify the homepage subscription value

- Replaced only the paragraph beneath “The subscription pays for tomorrow.”
  with the founder-approved explanation of what the subscription funds.
- Preserved the existing markup, emphasized ownership promise, layout,
  typography, spacing, hierarchy, styling, and every other copy surface.

---
## 2026-07-19 — Publish the 5.16.73 completed-trial library repair

### Scope and decision

- Advance the public Mac and Windows desktop surfaces to `5.16.73` only after
  both final artifacts and updater feeds are live at the download host.
- Explain the customer-visible outcome plainly: reaching the seven-day or
  250-save boundary pauses new capture but leaves every saved trial item
  available to browse, organize, compare, export, and manage.
- Include the prompt-navigation and Slideshow shortcut improvements without
  adding pricing or internal release-process details.
- Preserve all subscription, policy, extension, analytics, and unrelated site
  copy exactly as published.

### Files

- `release-notes.html`
- `index.html` and `get.html` through the established
  `scripts/update-version.sh 5.16.73` release gate
- `DEVLOG.md`

The sitemap already carried the current July 19 last-modified date, so the
version updater correctly produced no sitemap diff.

## 2026-07-19 — Publish the Windows 5.16.72 trial-startup hotfix

### Scope and decision

- Advance the public latest-desktop surfaces to `5.16.72` only after the
  Windows installer and updater manifest return HTTP `200` from production and
  the public installer matches the approved local SHA-256.
- Point Windows downloads directly to `5.16.72` so a new customer receives the
  repaired trial behavior on first launch.
- Keep the Mac download and updater feed on the already accepted, notarized
  `5.16.71` artifact. The trial-anchor defect is Windows-specific; an attempted
  `5.16.72` Mac build correctly stopped when Apple rejected the saved
  notarization credential, and no unnotarized artifact was published.
- Teach the existing release checker to verify the current Windows and Mac
  artifacts independently. Its normal version-bump command still converges
  both platforms to one version and refuses the bump until both artifacts are
  public.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `get.html`
- `release-notes.html`
- `scripts/update-version.sh`
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Customer-facing boundary

- Release copy says only that new Windows installations now begin the complete
  free trial reliably, including on established Windows accounts.
- No pricing, subscription policy, extension, analytics, Mac download,
  navigation, or unrelated site copy changed.

---
## 2026-07-19 — Prepare the public 5.16.71 subscription launch

### Scope and decision

- Advance the public desktop download surfaces from `5.16.70` to `5.16.71`
  only after the Mac and Windows artifacts return HTTP 200 from the production
  download host.
- Add a customer-facing `5.16.71` / Extension `5.121` release entry limited to
  current platform compatibility and the user-visible reliability fixes in
  this release. Keep pricing and commercial-policy details on the homepage,
  FAQ, support, and policy surfaces rather than the release notes.
- Preserve the founder-approved subscription and policy copy exactly. Do not
  reopen the settled commercial model during release closeout.

### Files

- `release-notes.html`
- `index.html`, `get.html`, and `sitemap.xml` through the established
  `scripts/update-version.sh 5.16.71` release gate
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Launch boundary

- Publish the site only after the desktop artifacts and Extension `5.121` are
  independently confirmed public.
- Keep the legacy perpetual Lemon Squeezy product unchanged. Enable only the
  approved `$99/year` product after the website is live, then verify checkout,
  downloads, update feeds, subscription authority health, and both license
  classes.

---
## 2026-07-19 — Simplify the homepage subscription promise

### Scope and decision

- Replace the homepage pricing card copy with the founder-approved commercial
  message: “The subscription pays for tomorrow. Your library is always yours.”
- Keep the card focused on trial terms, ongoing product value, the individual
  device allowance, and the permanent ownership promise.
- Remove first-payment, paid-period, cancellation-lifecycle, and lapse mechanics
  from the visible homepage. Those operational details remain available where
  customers expect them: FAQ, Terms, refund policy, and trial-complete surfaces.
- Align the Index price FAQ metadata with the same plain-language promise so
  search results do not reintroduce the operational copy removed from the page.
- Preserve the annual checkout URL, free-trial destination, pricing, behavior,
  navigation, and existing visual structure.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `scripts/check-subscription-draft.mjs`
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Validation and boundary

- Update the draft guard to require the new homepage ownership language and
  reject the displaced lifecycle phrases on the Index while continuing to
  require those details on the appropriate policy and support pages.
- Run the complete subscription-draft guard and diff checks locally.
- Keep the branch local. No push, deployment, checkout submission, sales
  activation, or website publication.

---
## 2026-07-18 — Standardize the Second Act Labs copyright notice

### Scope and decision

- Replace the three existing website-footer copyright variants with the exact
  approved notice: “© 2026 Second Act Labs. All rights reserved.”
- Apply it to every one of the 23 existing root HTML footers, including the
  homepage, resource pages, platform pages, guides, and blog pages. Existing
  footer structure, links, spacing, typography, and responsive behavior remain
  unchanged.
- Add a sitewide footer assertion to the existing subscription-draft guard so
  every current or future root HTML page with a footer must carry the canonical
  notice exactly once.

### Files

- Footer copy only in the 23 existing HTML files reported by
  `rg -l '<footer' --glob '*.html'`.
- `scripts/check-subscription-draft.mjs`
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Validation and boundary

- Run the complete subscription-draft guard, public-version check, diff check,
  and desktop/mobile footer visual review.
- Keep the branch local. No push, deployment, checkout submission, or website
  publication.

---
## 2026-07-18 — Clarify the permanent library promise

### Scope

- Founder review identified that “paid library” can sound as though some saved
  items are paid and others are not.
- Change only the ownership promise on the homepage pricing card and the three
  matching FAQ/Support/Terms lifecycle explanations. Do not otherwise polish,
  restructure, or alter the approved subscription copy.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `faq.html`
- `support.html`
- `terms.html`
- `scripts/check-subscription-draft.mjs`
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Copy decision

- The homepage now says: “Everything already in your library remains yours
  after your first payment.”
- Support uses the same ownership language while preserving the operational
  explanation of what pauses after a subscription ends.
- Terms refers to “your existing library,” not an “already-paid library.”
- The draft guard rejects future “paid library” and “already-paid library” copy
  across customer-facing sources.

### Boundary and validation

- Regenerate the affected desktop/mobile pricing and lifecycle screenshots,
  rerun the complete subscription-draft and public-version checks, and keep the
  branch local. No push, deployment, checkout submission, or sales activation.

---
## 2026-07-18 — Prepare the annual-subscription website draft

### Source and exact boundary

- Worktree:
  `/Users/danieldavis/Dev/worktrees/gencatalog-site-subscription-draft`.
- Branch: `codex/subscription-site-draft`, created from exact clean
  `origin/main` commit `daa0d77`.
- The canonical site checkout remains on `main` with its unrelated telemetry
  changes and uncommitted Midjourney testimonial untouched. The clean draft
  changes a separate commercial-copy hunk in `midjourney.html`; reconcile that
  file only after the testimonial work is committed in its own task.
- This is a local founder-review draft. No git push, PR, Cloudflare deployment,
  public checkout change, Lemon product publication, or website publication is
  authorized or performed.

### Commercial message

- New customers see one `$99/year`, billed-annually plan after the familiar
  seven-day-or-250-save trial; no card is required for the trial.
- Lead with the customer promise: “The subscription pays for tomorrow. Your
  library is always yours.” After the first payment, ending or refunding the
  subscription pauses new capture and imports without taking away management
  of work already in the catalog.
- Explain paid-through cancellation, renewal, three device activations,
  verification outages, current release availability, and permanent
  grandfathering without exposing runtime implementation language.
- Trial users who never paid are described honestly: GenCatalog pauses at the
  fork, while the files in their chosen catalog folder stay on their computer
  and are never deleted.

### Customer surfaces

- `index.html`
- `get.html`
- `faq.html`
- `support.html`
- `terms.html`
- `refund.html`
- `privacy.html`
- `llms.txt`
- `ai-generation-backup.html`
- `arcana.html`
- `blog-grok-favorites-disappeared.html`
- `blog-organize-grok-imagine.html`
- `comfyui-workflow-viewer.html`
- `digen.html`
- `grok.html`
- `higgsfield.html`
- `local-ai-media-import.html`
- `midjourney.html`
- `rescue-your-ai-library.html`
- `save-ai-prompts-locally.html`
- `search-grok-favorites.html`
- `brand/BRAND-VOICE.md`

### Validation and safety files

- `scripts/check-subscription-draft.mjs`
- `DEVLOG.md`

### Structured data and attribution

- Every priced `SoftwareApplication` offer now reports `$99 USD`, the approved
  annual checkout, and `UnitPriceSpecification.billingDuration: P1Y`.
- Homepage Open Graph, Twitter, FAQ schema, crawler copy, and visible pricing
  agree with the annual model.
- The existing generic Lemon checkout decorator continues to attach first/last
  source, channel, and surface attribution to the new checkout without code
  changes.

### Deliberate release boundary

- Keep public desktop download/version surfaces at `5.16.70` in this draft.
  The site must not point at `5.16.71` until compatible Mac and Windows
  artifacts actually exist at the public download URLs; the established
  version script enforces that later release gate.
- The draft contains the approved production annual checkout URL so copy and
  attribution can be reviewed exactly, but it exists only in this unpushed
  worktree.

### Validation

- `node scripts/check-subscription-draft.mjs`
- `git diff --check`
- Legacy `$79`, one-time-purchase, all-5.x, and legacy checkout sweep across
  customer HTML/text sources.
- JSON parsing for every JSON-LD block and annual-offer assertions for all
  priced application pages.
- Local Chromium review at desktop and mobile widths for homepage pricing,
  download handoff, subscription FAQ, support, terms, refund, and privacy.
- Review screenshots:
  `/Users/danieldavis/.codex/visualizations/2026/07/17/019f70df-3e35-74a1-b353-7764ae672134/subscription-launch-candidate-5.16.71/website-draft`.

### Parking record

- Keep this branch and worktree local for founder review. Do not push or deploy.
- Next action: incorporate review notes, reconcile the separately owned
  `midjourney.html` testimonial, rerun the draft guard and screenshots, then
  wait for compatible public desktop and extension releases before any site
  cutover.

## 2026-07-08 — Published 5.16.51 large-batch smoothness release

### What Changed
- Bumped public desktop download/version surfaces from 5.16.50 to 5.16.51 after
  the Mac and Windows artifacts were live.
- Added the 5.16.51 release note for smoother large-batch catalog saves and
  lighter sidebar refreshes during active imports.

### What I Learned
- Public copy for this release should stay focused on the practical feeling:
  fewer pauses while new items are being added to large catalogs, especially on
  external drives.

### Verification
- `scripts/update-version.sh 5.16.51`
- `scripts/update-version.sh --check`

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-07-04 — Published 5.16.44 desktop polish release

### What Changed
- Bumped public desktop download/version surfaces from 5.16.43 to 5.16.44 after
  the Mac and Windows artifacts were live.
- Added the 5.16.44 release note for more native desktop behavior, right-click
  catalog actions, smoother search typing, and cleaner accessibility/motion
  behavior.

### What I Learned
- This release is best described publicly as desktop polish users can feel:
  expected app menus, remembered windows, useful context menus, and fewer
  rough edges while typing or navigating.

### Verification
- `scripts/update-version.sh 5.16.44`
- `scripts/update-version.sh --check`

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-07-04 — Published 5.16.42 integrated repair release

### What Changed
- Bumped public desktop download/version surfaces from 5.16.41 to 5.16.42 after
  the Mac and Windows artifacts were live.
- Added the 5.16.42 release note for the integrated ComfyUI, Higgsfield,
  Midjourney, Local files color, and Shift+Arrow selection fixes.

### What I Learned
- Public release copy should describe the visible recovery: one build that
  includes the recent fixes users rely on, without exposing branch cleanup or
  release-source mechanics.

### Verification
- `scripts/update-version.sh 5.16.42`
- `scripts/update-version.sh --check`

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

## 2026-07-04 — Published 5.16.41 Higgsfield video repair

### What Changed
- Bumped public desktop download/version surfaces from 5.16.40 to 5.16.41 after
  the Mac and Windows artifacts were live.
- Added the 5.16.41 release note for Higgsfield video repair sync and safer
  bulk video imports that avoid saving preview thumbnails as videos.

### What I Learned
- Public release copy should state the customer-visible Higgsfield outcome:
  broken thumbnail-only records are repaired by sync, and unavailable video
  media fails clearly instead of creating another bad catalog item.

### Verification
- `scripts/update-version.sh 5.16.41`
- `scripts/update-version.sh --check`

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-07-03 — Updated ComfyUI import website copy

### What Changed
- Updated the homepage metadata, platform strip, source-filter copy, and Local
  Import feature section to describe ComfyUI output imports and embedded
  workflow metadata.
- Expanded FAQ metadata, structured FAQ data, visible platform guidance, and
  local import answers with ComfyUI prompts, checkpoints, settings, and LoRAs.
- Added support-page ComfyUI import guidance under Local Media Import, including
  LoRA strength/model/clip values and the source-versus-checkpoint distinction.
- Reworked the local AI media import SEO page around ComfyUI output folders
  while keeping ordinary downloaded media and API outputs covered.

### What I Learned
- The clearest public framing is that ComfyUI is a creation tool/import source,
  while the checkpoint remains the searchable model. The copy should emphasize
  automatic metadata recovery when embedded data exists, then manual review for
  ordinary local files.

### Verification
- `node` JSON-LD parse check for `index.html`, `faq.html`, `support.html`, and
  `local-ai-media-import.html`
- `git diff --check`
- `xmllint --noout sitemap.xml`
- `scripts/update-version.sh --check`
- Pending: live production polling after push.

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

## 2026-07-03 — Published 5.16.40 ComfyUI LoRA hotfix

### What Changed
- Bumped public desktop download/version surfaces from 5.16.39 to 5.16.40 after
  the Mac and Windows artifacts were live.
- Added the 5.16.40 release note for fuller ComfyUI LoRA metadata capture,
  readable stacked LoRA lists, and compact ComfyUI Recipe Cards.

### What I Learned
- Public ComfyUI copy should separate detail-panel fidelity from shareable
  Recipe Card readability: full LoRA details belong in the app detail view,
  while cards need a concise summary.

### Verification
- `scripts/update-version.sh --check`
- `xmllint --noout sitemap.xml`
- `git diff --check`

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-07-03 — Published 5.16.39 ComfyUI release and SEO page

### What Changed
- Bumped public desktop download/version surfaces from 5.16.38 to 5.16.39 after
  the Mac and Windows artifacts were live.
- Added the 5.16.39 release note for ComfyUI folder imports, searchable ComfyUI
  settings and LoRAs, and clearer ComfyUI/Rogue Studio labels.
- Added `/comfyui-workflow-viewer` as a search-intent page for creators who
  need to browse and search ComfyUI output folders, embedded workflow metadata,
  prompts, checkpoints, seeds, CFG, sampler/scheduler settings, and LoRAs.
- Linked the new page from Guides, local import, AI backup, prompt recovery,
  rescue, `llms.txt`, and `sitemap.xml`.

### What I Learned
- The strongest public framing is "ComfyUI output folder to searchable local
  workflow library." ComfyUI should be described as a creation tool/source, with
  checkpoints and LoRAs presented as searchable generation ingredients.

### Verification
- `scripts/update-version.sh 5.16.39`
- `scripts/update-version.sh --check`

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-07-03 — Strengthened local AI media import narrative

### What Changed
- Reworked `/local-ai-media-import` from a feature-first explanation into a recovery-focused page for creators with existing AI download folders, exported ZIPs, external drives, local tool outputs, and old projects.
- Moved the core insight higher: the files may be saved, but the archive is not usable when creative context is gone.
- Added a Before/After comparison, a Local Import differentiator section for yesterday's work, an anonymous Chrome Web Store proof quote, and an outcome-led CTA.
- Updated meta and structured-data language to include natural search phrases around downloaded AI images, downloaded AI videos, existing AI generations, AI prompt archive, and AI media library.

### What I Learned
- The stronger conversion story is emotional recovery first, file import second: GenCatalog helps users rediscover and reconnect with a library they already spent time building.

### Verification
- `git diff --check`
- `scripts/update-version.sh --check`
- Local `curl` smoke confirmed `/local-ai-media-import.html` and `uploads_v2/LocalImportReview.png` return `200`, and the served page includes the new hero, Before/After section, proof quote, and CTA.

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-07-03 — Added prompt recovery intent pages

### What Changed
- Added `/save-grok-prompts` for Grok creators who need to preserve prompts, source context, and saved outputs together.
- Added `/save-ai-prompts-locally` for the broader local AI prompt archive workflow.
- Linked both pages from `/guides` and added them to `sitemap.xml`.

### What I Learned
- The site does not have a separate generator for the problem-intent pages; the existing static guide/article pages provide the reusable problem, workflow, related-links, and CTA structure.
- The prompt-preservation copy should stay focused on creator recovery: find the file, recover the prompt, understand the context, and make the next GenCatalog action explicit.

### Verification
- `git diff --check`
- `xmllint --noout sitemap.xml`
- `scripts/update-version.sh --check`

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-07-03 — Added local AI media import SEO page

### What Changed
- Added `/local-ai-media-import` as a problem-intent SEO page for AI creators with existing folders of downloaded generations.
- Focused the page on the concrete GenCatalog local import workflow: Import button, drag-and-drop, Settings import, duplicate hash checks, batch review, tags, prompts, notes, and search.
- Added the page to the Guides index and sitemap so it is internally linked and discoverable.

### What I Learned
- Local import is already described in support/FAQ as a customer-facing workflow, so the new page mirrors those exact entry points and file-type claims instead of inventing broader import promises.
- The strongest intent is not generic "AI organizer"; it is the folder-to-library transition for people whose media is saved but not retrievable.

### Verification
- `git diff --check`
- `xmllint --noout sitemap.xml`
- `scripts/update-version.sh --check`

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-07-03 — Added Chrome extension 5.64 availability note

### What Changed
- Added a latest-release note that Rogue Studio support and the new Higgsfield bulk sync require Chrome extension 5.64.
- Noted that extension 5.64 has been uploaded to the Chrome Web Store and will be available after approval.

### Verification
- Confirmed the latest release notes include a Chrome extension 5.64 availability note.
- `git diff --check`

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-07-03 — Shortened Grok large-library release copy

### What Changed
- Rewrote the Grok large-library release note to focus on the user-visible reliability improvement instead of connection-recovery details.

### Verification
- Confirmed the release-note paragraph no longer mentions extension connection or tab reconnection details.
- `git diff --check`

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-07-03 — Simplified Higgsfield release-note copy

### What Changed
- Rewrote the Higgsfield bulk-sync release note to describe the customer outcome instead of background-worker implementation details.

### Verification
- Confirmed the release-note paragraph no longer mentions background-worker or service-worker implementation details.
- `git diff --check`

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-07-02 — Removed Higgsfield helper support section

### What Changed
- Removed the support sidebar link and support-page instructions for the old Higgsfield helper script.
- Updated the Higgsfield bulk-save copy to describe the built-in Sync New flow that can open queued detail pages automatically for prompts and metadata.

### Verification
- Confirmed `support.html` no longer references `higgsfield-helper`, `Hit the Griddy`, `hit-the-griddy`, console steps, or `stopSync`.
- Confirmed the Higgsfield sidebar link list and bulk-save section render coherently in the edited HTML.
- `git diff --check`

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-07-02 — Made telemetry dashboard useful

### What Changed
- Expanded `/admin/telemetry` from a basic counter page into an operator view
  with app opens, feature usage, library-size buckets, version adoption, daily
  app-open trend, platform/media/OS/failure breakdowns, recent aggregate rows,
  `?days=` range controls, and `?format=json` export.
- Updated `/api/telemetry` to accept the new allowlisted feature usage and
  bucketed library-size dimensions while keeping blocked content-shaped keys
  fail-closed.
- Kept the dashboard private behind Cloudflare Access headers.
- Added `scripts/telemetry-report.mjs` to generate the same kind of useful
  dashboard from R2 locally without running a Python localhost server.

### Verification
- Local function smoke confirmed HTML and JSON responses render with fake R2
  data and Access-shaped headers, including feature and library-size sections.
- Local function smoke confirmed the route still returns `403` without Access
  headers.
- `npx wrangler pages functions build .`
- Live spoofed Access-header check still returned `403`.
- `scripts/telemetry-report.mjs /tmp/gencatalog-telemetry-dashboard.html`
  generated a local HTML dashboard from the R2 summaries.
- Pending: deploy and live Access-protected dashboard check.

---
## 2026-06-29 — Wired privacy-safe telemetry storage

### What Changed
- Added a Cloudflare Pages R2 binding for dedicated telemetry storage.
- Updated `/api/telemetry` to store only allowlisted aggregate counters in R2
  daily summaries.
- Kept invalid or non-allowlisted telemetry fail-closed: unsupported payloads
  are ignored and no request metadata is stored.
- Updated `/admin/telemetry` into a private read-only dashboard that reads the
  summaries and requires Cloudflare Access headers.
- Added `.wrangler/` to `.gitignore` so local Cloudflare cache files stay out
  of commits.

### Verification
- `wrangler pages functions build .`
- Local module smoke confirmed a valid aggregate payload stores one R2 daily
  summary object.
- Local module smoke confirmed a blocked `prompt` dimension returns `204` and
  stores nothing.
- Local module smoke confirmed `/admin/telemetry` returns `403` without
  Cloudflare Access headers and renders with Access-shaped headers.

### Status
- `gencatalog-telemetry` R2 bucket created; ready to deploy via Cloudflare
  Pages.

---
## 2026-06-29 — Emphasized privacy plain-English promise

### What Changed
- Made the final plain-English privacy promise in `/privacy` bold and accent
  colored.

### Verification
- Confirmed the copy remains unchanged except for presentation.

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on merge/push.

---
## 2026-06-29 — Published 5.16.32 site surfaces

### What Changed
- Added the GenCatalog 5.16.32 release notes entry.
- Updated homepage and download page version surfaces to 5.16.32.
- Kept the opt-in telemetry privacy scaffold and updated privacy-policy copy on
  the same deployment branch.

### Verification
- `scripts/update-version.sh 5.16.32`
- `scripts/update-version.sh --check`
- Confirmed the 5.16.32 macOS DMG and Windows installer returned `200` before
  bumping public version surfaces.

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on merge/push.

---
## 2026-06-29 — Scaffolded opt-in telemetry surfaces

### What Changed
- Updated `/privacy` to describe opt-in aggregate app telemetry while keeping
  the local-library privacy promise explicit.
- Added a fail-closed `/api/telemetry` Cloudflare Pages Function scaffold that
  validates aggregate rows only and does not assume a storage binding.
- Added a disabled `/admin/telemetry` scaffold that requires Cloudflare Access
  headers before returning anything.
- Documented the remaining storage decision in code: Analytics Engine versus
  R2 daily summaries.

### Verification
- Local module smoke confirmed `/api/telemetry` returns `202` with
  `stored:false` for a schema-versioned aggregate payload.
- Local module smoke confirmed `/api/telemetry` returns `204` for a payload
  containing a blocked content key.
- Local module smoke confirmed `/admin/telemetry` returns `403` without
  Cloudflare Access headers and `501` scaffold-only with the Access header.
- `git diff --check`

### Status
- Ready to deploy after the app-side telemetry foundation is reviewed.

---
## 2026-06-29 — Cache-busted Recipe Card landing image

### What Changed
- Added `/recipe-card-demo-2026-06-29.webp` and pointed `/r.html` at it so
  the refreshed Recipe Card example is not blocked by immutable caching of the
  previous `/recipe-card-demo.webp` asset.

### Verification
- Confirmed the live old asset was still serving the previous 107540-byte file
  with `cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.
- Confirmed the new asset is a 1040x1440 lossless WebP.

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-06-29 — Refreshed Recipe Card landing example

### What Changed
- Replaced the `/r` landing page Recipe Card sample image with the supplied
  exported card.
- Kept the existing `/recipe-card-demo.webp` asset path so `/r.html` markup
  and public copy stayed unchanged.

### Verification
- Converted the supplied 1040x1440 PNG to a lossless WebP at the existing
  asset path.
- Confirmed `/r.html` still references `/recipe-card-demo.webp`.

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-06-29 — Fixed live Recipe Card landing route

### What Changed
- Removed the `/r /r.html 200` Cloudflare Pages rewrite because Pages already
  canonicalizes `/r.html` to `/r`, and the rewrite caused a `/r` redirect loop.
- Embedded the small GenCatalog header mark directly in `/r.html` so the top
  left brand icon works in both live and local file previews.

### Verification
- Confirmed live `/r` was returning repeated `308 location: /r` responses
  before the fix.
- Confirmed the page still references the Recipe Card sample image.

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-06-29 — Updated Recipe Card landing example

### What Changed
- Replaced the `/r` landing page example image with a real exported Recipe
  Card sample.
- Kept the existing `/recipe-card-demo.webp` asset path so the landing page
  markup did not need to change.

### Verification
- Confirmed the replacement asset is a 1040x1440 WebP.
- Confirmed `/r.html` still references `/recipe-card-demo.webp`.

### Status
- Ready to deploy via Cloudflare Pages on push.

---
## 2026-06-29 — Added Recipe Card attribution landing page

### What Changed
- Added `/r` as a lightweight Recipe Card landing page for campaign-level
  attribution from shared PNGs.
- Added a Cloudflare Pages rewrite from `/r` to `/r.html`.
- Kept the page generic: it explains that the shared image was made with
  GenCatalog, points visitors to download or learn more, and states that the
  shared image was not uploaded or tied to the exporter.
- Preserved incoming UTM parameters on the page CTAs so `/get` and homepage
  visits can keep the recipe-card campaign context.

### Files
- `r.html`
- `_redirects`
- `DEVLOG.md`

## 2026-06-10 — Audit fixes: privacy scoping, trust cleanup, 404, image weight (Batches 1–3)

### What Changed
- Rewrote `/privacy` to scope no-telemetry claims to the app/extension and disclose website Google Analytics + localStorage attribution honestly. GA stays installed.
- Deleted the dormant `#hero-counter` fake-counter block from `site.js`.
- Removed the unsourced @grok pull quote from the homepage (no post URL available to cite).
- Unified trial framing site-wide: "7 days or 250 generations, whichever comes first, no credit card." Fixed `llms.txt` ("100 items" → 250-generation framing) and pointed its download link at `/get` instead of a versioned DMG so it can't go stale.
- Standardized performance claims to "tested with catalogs of 30,000+ items."
- "Includes all v1 updates" → "Includes all 5.x updates" (pricing card + FAQ JSON-LD).
- Added `404.html` (Cloudflare Pages now returns real 404s instead of soft-200 homepage fallback).
- Added `_redirects` keeping DEVLOG.md, AGENTS.md, AUDIT.md, the Search Console report, `brand/`, and `scripts/` out of public reach.
- Added `scripts/update-version.sh` + version consistency check.
- Converted oversized homepage/platform images to right-sized WebP; added lazy-loading and width/height attributes; fixed `/#how-it-works` → `/#how`; fixed higgsfield picture fallback; added long-lived asset caching to `_headers`.

### Manual follow-up: www subdomain (NXDOMAIN today)
`www.gencatalog.app` does not resolve — anyone typing www gets a browser error. Fix in the Cloudflare dashboard (no code change possible):
1. Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → the gencatalog.app Pages project → **Custom domains** → Add `www.gencatalog.app`. Pages will create the DNS record and route it.
2. Then add a redirect to apex: dashboard → the gencatalog.app zone → **Rules → Redirect Rules** → create rule: if hostname equals `www.gencatalog.app`, 301 to `https://gencatalog.app` preserving path and query. (Or use Bulk Redirects.)
3. Verify: `curl -sI https://www.gencatalog.app/` returns 301 → `https://gencatalog.app/`.
4. Optional afterward: submit to hstspreload.org (preload requires the working www redirect).

### Verification
- Public download URLs for the current released desktop version verified `200` before completion.
- Grep checks: no `hero-counter`, no stale `5.16.0` DMG link, no `/#how-it-works`, no "100 items".

---
## Rules / Conventions

### R2 release artifacts must live at the bucket root
The public hostname `downloads.gencatalog.app` serves from the **root** of the `gencatalog-downloads` R2 bucket — **not** from `updates/`.

When a release is uploaded to `gencatalog-downloads/updates/...`, the site's download buttons (which point at `downloads.gencatalog.app/GenCatalog-X.Y.Z-universal.dmg`) return `File not found` to end users.

**On every release, copy these files from `updates/` to the bucket root:**
- `GenCatalog-<version>-universal.dmg` + `.blockmap`
- `GenCatalog-<version>-universal-mac.zip` + `.blockmap`
- `GenCatalog-<version>-Setup.exe` + `.blockmap`
- `GenCatalog-Extension-v<version>.zip` (if a new extension ships)
- `latest.yml` (overwrites prior — flips electron-updater on Windows)
- `latest-mac.yml` (overwrites prior — flips electron-updater on Mac)

Fast way (rclone with the `r2` remote configured):
```
for f in <files>; do rclone copyto "r2:gencatalog-downloads/updates/$f" "r2:gencatalog-downloads/$f"; done
```

Verify each URL returns `200` via `curl -I https://downloads.gencatalog.app/<file>` before announcing the release. Leave the `updates/` copies in place as an archive.

### Validation
- `node scripts/check-subscription-draft.mjs` — passed across 30 customer
  files, 53 JSON-LD blocks, 23 canonical footers, and the annual checkout.
- The checker now rejects obsolete perpetual-sale, lifetime-update,
  payment-processor, device-activation, pre-payment ownership, former-business
  name, and broad subscription-funded-feature language.

### Provenance and parking note
- Re-authored only the three commits on this unpushed website draft as
  `Second Act Labs <support@gencatalog.app>`; published history was untouched.
- One additional wording-only consistency occurrence was found in
  `blog-organize-grok-imagine.html:600`. It is outside the approved file list
  and remains parked pending explicit approval to change "first payment" to
  "first successful payment."

### Lesson
The trial promise and the paid ownership promise must not collapse into one
slogan. Trial files stay on disk; permanent in-app access begins after the
first successful payment.
